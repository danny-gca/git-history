# git-history

## Description
This project allows you to get a detailed history by commit of your repository.
You must enter your email and the path to a repository.
The program will browse all the commits that concern the requested user and generate a file in CSV format.
The path to the file is displayed at the end of the program.

It allows you to obtain, on each commit, the following data:
- The commit id
- The branch name
- The commit title
- The number of modified files
- The number of added lines
- The number of deleted lines
- The date of the commit
- The time of the commit
